## Chatbot Response System in Python (using NLTK) 

The Intelligent Python Chatbot project aims to enhance the user experience by providing a conversational and intelligent interface capable of understanding and responding to user queries effectively. This project presents an opportunity to explore and implement NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms in the field of chatbot development.

## NLP
NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.

## Prerequisites
### NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a powerful Python library widely used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. It provides various tools and resources for tasks such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, and more. NLTK is open-source and offers a vast collection of text corpora, lexical resources, and pre-trained models for research and development in NLP.

Installation of NLTK
```
pip install nltk
```
## How To Run
* Jupyter Notebook

You can run the chatbot.ipynb which also includes step by step instructions.

* Through Terminal
```
python chatbot.py
```

## History 

History of chatbots dates back to 1966 when a computer program called ELIZA was invented by Weizenbaum. It imitated the language of a psychotherapist from only 200 lines of code. You can still converse with it here: [Eliza](http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm?utm_source=ubisend.com&utm_medium=blog-link&utm_campaign=ubisend).

## Build a Simple Chatbot from Scratch in Python (using NLTK)

History of chatbots dates back to 1966 when a computer program called ELIZA was invented by Weizenbaum. It imitated the language of a psychotherapist from only 200 lines of code. You can still converse with it here: [Eliza](http://psych.fullerton.edu/mbirnbaum/psych101/Eliza.htm?utm_source=ubisend.com&utm_medium=blog-link&utm_campaign=ubisend). 

## NLP
NLP is a way for computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language in a smart and useful way. By utilizing NLP, developers can organize and structure knowledge to perform tasks such as automatic summarization, translation, named entity recognition, relationship extraction, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and topic segmentation.
